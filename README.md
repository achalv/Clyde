Clyde
=====

Code for the Arduino powered car named Clyde. &lt;3

Clyde was my project for ECE110 - 'Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering' in the Fall 2012 semester.

Clyde can navigate sharp, smooth and jagged turns, and is also smart enough to choose which path to pick when he reaches a fork 'in the woods', unlike Rober Frost.

I put in a lot of time prepping Clyde, and I hope you find some use for the program I wrote to make him what he his.
